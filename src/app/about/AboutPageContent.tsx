                                    Being a standalone IITM BS student, campus life and student bodies meant everything to me.
                                    Through student activity bodies and Paradox, I met some of the most like-minded people of my life.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And then came the realization: So many students would never experience this.
                                    Not because they didn't want to — but because the system didn't allow them to.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I could have just attended Paradox, enjoyed my experience, and moved on.
                                    But once you've felt belonging, you can't ignore those who never will.
